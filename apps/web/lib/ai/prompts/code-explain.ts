    1.  **Clarity**: Explain the code in a clear and concise manner, suitable for a developer who may not be familiar with this specific code or language nuances.
    2.  **Purpose**: Describe the overall purpose or functionality of the code snippet. What does it do?
    3.  **Key Elements**: Identify and explain key variables, functions, classes, and logic sections.
    4.  **Control Flow**: Briefly describe the control flow if it's relevant (e.g., loops, conditionals).

    7.  **Brevity**: Be informative but not overly verbose. Focus on the most important aspects.
    8.  **Formatting**: Use markdown for formatting if it helps readability (e.g., code blocks for small snippets, bold for emphasis).

    Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks like "Sure, I can help with that!" or "Let me know if you have other questions!".
    Just provide the explanation directly.
