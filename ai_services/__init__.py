# This file makes ai_services a Python package

# Try to expose the required names from a submodule, e.g., 'manager.py' or 'core.py'
# Assuming the actual implementations are in such files.
# This is a common pattern. If these files don't exist, this will fail,
# but it's an attempt to fix the current ImportError.

# Attempt 1: Assuming a 'manager.py' holds these (very common)
try:
    from .manager import (
        initialize_ai_services,
        get_ai_manager,
        CodeContext,
        AIResponse,
        AIServiceError
    )
except ImportError as e:
    # If manager.py doesn't exist or doesn't have all names, store the error.
    # This helps in understanding if this assumption was wrong.
    _manager_import_error = e

# Attempt 2: Assuming a 'core.py' (also common)
# Only try if the first one failed comprehensively for 'initialize_ai_services' specifically.
# This complex conditional logic is hard to get right here.
# For now, let's just try one common pattern. If this fails, the error will tell us.

# If, after trying, 'initialize_ai_services' is still not defined,
# raise an ImportError to make it clear the __init__.py couldn't find it.
# This helps to avoid masking the original "cannot import name" problem.
# (This check is more for runtime, the test will fail on the import from main.py anyway)

# For the purpose of the test, let's assume 'manager.py' is the most plausible
# and if it's not there, the test will fail with a clear "No module named ai_services.manager"
# or a continued "cannot import name initialize_ai_services from ai_services".

# The goal is that `from ai_services import initialize_ai_services` should work.
# This implies initialize_ai_services should be an attribute of the ai_services package.
# This is achieved by defining it in __init__.py or importing it into __init__.py's namespace.

# Let's assume 'initialize_ai_services' and 'get_ai_manager' are from 'ai_manager_module.py'
# and the data classes/exceptions are from 'models.py' and 'exceptions.py'
# This is a more structured guess.

from .ai_manager_module import initialize_ai_services, get_ai_manager
from .ai_models import CodeContext, AIResponse # Assuming models might be in 'ai_models.py'
from .ai_exceptions import AIServiceError   # Assuming exceptions might be in 'ai_exceptions.py'

# If the above lines fail, it means these submodules don't exist or don't contain these names.
# This is a guess because `ls("ai_services")` is not showing the internal files.
# The error message from the test run will guide the next step.
# If it says "No module named ai_services.ai_manager_module", then that file is missing.
# If it says "cannot import name initialize_ai_services from ai_services.ai_manager_module",
# then the file exists, but the function is not in it or has a different name.
#
# Given the repeated failure of `ls`, and the nature of the error,
# the problem is *most likely* that `ai_services` is a folder,
# it now has `__init__.py`, but `main.py` is trying to import names
# that are defined in other .py files inside `ai_services/*` which are not
# automatically exposed by the package. The `__init__.py` must explicitly import them.

# Let's go with the simplest assumption that all these names are in a single module,
# for example, `interface.py` or `services.py` inside the `ai_services` directory.
# Or, given the names, they might be in a file called `ai_services.py` itself,
# making the structure `ai_services/ai_services.py`. This is less common but possible.

# Let's try to import from specific, plausible module names based on the items.
# This is the most structured guess I can make.
# from .manager import initialize_ai_services, get_ai_manager
# from .context import CodeContext
# from .response import AIResponse
# from .exceptions import AIServiceError

# Given the tool's limitations and the repeated import errors,
# I will try the most direct approach: assume the names are in modules
# that are similarly named or are in a central module like `core.py`.
# The previous test error was `ImportError: cannot import name 'initialize_ai_services' from 'ai_services' (/app/ai_services/__init__.py)`
# This means the `__init__.py` is being read.

# Let's assume there is a module, say `main_module.py` inside `ai_services` folder that holds these.
# `ai_services/main_module.py`
# And `ai_services/__init__.py` should be:
# from .main_module import (
# initialize_ai_services,
# get_ai_manager,
# CodeContext,
# AIResponse,
# AIServiceError
# )
# This is the most robust guess I can make.
# I will use 'core_services.py' as the hypothetical filename.

from .core_services import (
    initialize_ai_services,
    get_ai_manager,
    CodeContext,
    AIResponse,
    AIServiceError
)

# If this also fails, the next error message will tell us if 'core_services.py'
# itself is not found, or if the names are not in it.
# This is the best I can do without `ls()` providing the contents of `ai_services`.
